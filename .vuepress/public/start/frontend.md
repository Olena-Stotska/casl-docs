# CASL frontend

CASL (pronounced /ˈkæsəl/, like **castle**) is an isomorphic authorization JavaScript library which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. All permissions are defined in a single location (the `Ability` class) and not duplicated across UI components, API services, and database queries.
